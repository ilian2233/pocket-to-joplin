# pocket-to-joplin

## This tool was generated by ChatGPT. The prompt was as follows:

You are to write a Go Command-Line Tool to Integrate with Pocket and Joplin APIs

Algorithm:
Fetch all unread articles saved in the user's Pocket account.
Check if a to_read tag exists in the Joplin application. If not, create it.
Check if a folder named Main exists in the Joplin application. If not, create it.
Create a note in the Joplin application for each fetched article using the POST /tags/:id/notes endpoint.
Each note should contain the article's title and URL, and be placed under the Main folder using its parent_id.
Joplin is running locally on port 41184.

Requirements:
The Go tool should use only the standard library, without any external dependencies.
The tool should read necessary API keys and URLs from environment variables:
POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY
POCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN

### Touch-ups

After the initial generation, I made a few touch-ups to the code to ensure it works as expected. The code is now able to fetch articles from Pocket and create notes in Joplin.

The touch-ups include:
- adding JOPLIN_TOKEN environment variable;
- fixing expected response types for the `fetch*` joplin functions.
- exported environment variables in a structure.
